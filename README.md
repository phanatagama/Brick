# brick_game

This project is a learning journey into the world of game development using the Flame game engine, guided by Google's codelab. It's built with Flutter, leveraging the Dart programming language, and developed using Visual Studio Code as the primary IDE.

## Project Overview

The `brick_game` project is an exploration into the capabilities of the Flame game engine, a versatile and powerful platform for game development in Flutter. This project was created as a part of a learning process based on [Google's codelab](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/flutter-flame-brick-breaker), aiming to understand the intricacies of game development, from rendering and animations to game logic and state management.

## Getting Started
